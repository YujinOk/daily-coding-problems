# Daily Coding Problems

This repository is where I practice coding problems every day to sharpen my problem-solving and algorithmic skills. The problems range from basic to advanced levels, covering various topics like data structures, algorithms, and general coding challenges.

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific problem set or day.
- Files are typically named as `solution1.ts`, `solution2.ts`, and so on.
- Code is written primarily in TypeScript.
